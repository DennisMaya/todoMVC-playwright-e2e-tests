# --- Default behavior: normalize text files to LF in repo ---
* text=auto eol=lf

# --- Windows-specific note ---
# On Windows, Git will still check out files as CRLF in your working copy
# if core.autocrlf=true, but the repo will store LF only.

# --- Source code files ---
*.js     text eol=lf
*.ts     text eol=lf
*.json   text eol=lf
*.md     text eol=lf
*.yml    text eol=lf
*.yaml   text eol=lf
*.css    text eol=lf
*.html   text eol=lf

# --- Ignore line ending normalization for generated artifacts ---
# This prevents Git from touching them and avoids the LF/CRLF warning
